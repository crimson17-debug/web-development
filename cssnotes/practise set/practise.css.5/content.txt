

I need to center the inner div using flex box 
first i need a container and a item
outer div is my container 
inner div is my item
so i am gonna display flex for container-----------------display flex
make sure the item is at the center as well. -------use flex justify-content center
and align the item at the center---------------alighn-items center --------------always along the cross axissss

remember make a container with an item and then use all flex properties for the container only
use self-allign for individual item or else for all the properties it should be the container...

If both align-items (on the parent) and align-self (on the child) are defined, 
the align-self value will be applied to the child item, overriding the parentâ€™s align-items.
