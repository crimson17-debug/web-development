INSIGHTS:
RELATIVE:
The element is still in the document.
so when i set the position to relative it basically shifted it's place but the space allocated was still fixed.

ABSOLUTE:
The element is out of the document.
so when i set the position to absolute it basically shifted and moved to front and the space is taken by the next element.

so the box i applied the absolute position is toping the other element.
1.so i applied a padding of 3px to the box2 element and i expected the box1 to be at exact center. false.
2.so i have to apply a top and left of 3px and see.
